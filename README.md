# MovieDigger

Clone of private repostiory, had to remove the history to hide API keys and such.

This was an one month school project where we were given the task to develop a mobile application. We chose to develop an android application that gives the user all recent movie news.

This application uses some google apis for youtube and maps but also themoviedb to obtain movie information. This information is retrieved from a flask server.
